## Schema

### Optional

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) API key to use when interacting with the API. You can generate an API key from the user settings on the Render dashboard. The provider will read this value from the RENDER_API_KEY environment variable if set. This key is sensitive and should not be committed to source control.
- `owner_id` (String) The user or team ID that owns the managed resources. All resources will be created under this owner ID. You can find the owner ID in the Render dashboard by navigating to the user or team settings and finding the ID in the URL. The ID will start with usr- for individual accounts and tea- for team accounts. The provider will read this value from the RENDER_OWNER_ID environment variable if set.
