## Schema

### Required

- `environments` (Attributes Map) List of environments (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--environments))
- `name` (String) Name of the project

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the project

<a id="nestedatt--environments"></a>
### Nested Schema for `environments`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the environment
- `protected_status` (String) Protected environment status. One of `protected`, `unprotected`

Optional:

- `id` (String) Unique identifier of the environment
- `ip_allow_list` (Attributes Set) List of IP addresses that are allowed to connect to the web service. If omitted, the API default (0.0.0.0/0 - allow all) is used. If set to an empty list, all traffic is blocked. If removed after being set, it reverts to the default (0.0.0.0/0). This is an enterprise-only feature. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--environments--ip_allow_list))
- `network_isolated` (Boolean) Whether services within this environment are isolated from network requests from other environments

<a id="nestedatt--environments--ip_allow_list"></a>
### Nested Schema for `environments.ip_allow_list`

Required:

- `cidr_block` (String) CIDR block that is allowed to connect to the Redis instance. (0.0.0.0/0 to allow traffic from all IPs)
- `description` (String) Description of the IP address or range. This is used to help identify the IP address or range in the list.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import a project using the project ID
# The keys of the environment map must match the names of the environment.
terraform import render_project.resource_name prj-cpku2n5qtlos70htpqbg
```
